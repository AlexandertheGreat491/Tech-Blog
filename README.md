## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a CMS-style blog site where users can make posts and comment on posts, while they are logged in to the application. I learned how to utilize the Handlebars engine to create the front end for an application based on the Model-View-Controller structure, which creates models with JavaScript and a MySQL database, creates a view using Handlebars.js, and is controlled through routes for the front end and back end and are protected by middleware.

## Installation

Please use the following steps to install the application on your local computer:

Step 1: Access the [Public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlexandertheGreat491/Tech-Blog.git) and clone the code to your local computer.

Step 2: In your terminal sign in to your MySQL by running:
mysql -u <your username> -p

Step 3: Enter your MySQL password when prompted and then run this command to create the tech_blog_cms_db database:

source db/schema.sql

Step 4: Then run the command:

npm run seeds

This will create the user, post, and comment tables, as well as add the values to the tables.

Step 4: In your terminal run the command:

npm i

This will create the node_modules folder and give you access to all of the neceassary libraries.

Step 5: Rename the .envEXAMPLE file to .env and fill it in with the correct information.

Step 6: create a .gitignore file and add node_modules and .env to it.

Step 7: In your terminal run npm install -g nodemon, if you don't already have nodemon installed globally.

Step 8: Run the command in your terminal: nodemon

Step 9: Now you can run the app locally.

Step 10: insert heroku link here



## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
